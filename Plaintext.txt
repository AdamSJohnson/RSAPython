CIS 475 Introduction to Cryptography. Assignment 3 (Spring 2018)
For this assignment, provide your own implementation of the RSA
crypto system in any programming language of your choice.
Allow the user a freedom to choose the bit-length for their
prime numbers. Your system should encrypt only single ASCII characters
from text files without salting.
Your program should take four input parameters: a plaintext filename,
a ciphertext filename, and a filename for the decrypted text, and
a bit-length parameter. The ciphertext should be an ASCII file that
is a sequence of numbers separated by newlines. Once you have a working program, encrypt this
text file using your own seperate RSA keys and save the cipher in a text file named RSAcipher.txt
For the submission, submit RSAcipher.txt along with the RSA modulus and the
secret exponent required to decrypt the file so I can decrypt it properly. The due date for
this assignment is March 5.
